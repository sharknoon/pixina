  "informations-title": "Hi! 👋",
  "informations-body": "Welcome to my website, which serves to build the artwork \"Place\". Glad you found your way here.",
  "informations-faq": "FAQ",
  "informations-faq-pixina-title": "What is Pixina?",
  "informations-faq-pixina-text": "Pixina is this website that accompanies the creation and construction of a work of art from many small physical pixels.",
  "informations-faq-place-title": "What is Place?",
  "informations-faq-place-text": "From April 1 - 3, 2017, there was a social experiment on the Reddit forum. For three days, Reddit users could place pixels on a 1000 x 1000 pixel white field. This field was called Place. However, there were limitations. For example, users could only place a pixel every ~5 minutes. Likewise, they only had 16 colors to choose from. In addition, the space was limited to one million pixels. This meant that users had to coordinate with each other if they wanted to paint a larger picture. In addition, the pixels could be overwritten again by other users, creating a battle for valuable space.",
  "informations-faq-reddit-title": "What is Reddit?",
  "informations-faq-reddit-text": "Reddit is a forum in which users can exchange information. The forum does not focus on specific topics. Instead, anyone can create their own subforum (subreddit) for a specific topic and exchange ideas with other Reddit members there.",
  "informations-faq-art-title": "What kind of artwork is being created here?",
  "informations-faq-art-text": "The goal of this artwork is to recreate Reddit Place, which is considered a piece of Internet culture, in the real world. This is done by putting the pixels set by Reddit users on pegboards and thus having a representation in the real world.",
  "informations-faq-size-title": "How big will the artwork be?",
  "informations-faq-size-text": "2,5m x 2,5m (8.2ft x 8.2ft)",
  "informations-faq-duration-title": "How long does it take to create the artwork?",
  "informations-faq-duration-text": "The total image consists of 500 plates, which are later assembled. On average, one plate (50 x 40 pixels) will take 3 hours to complete, giving a total estimated time of 1500 hours for pixelling alone. With the organization and programming, it will probably end up being over 2000 person hours. Approximately 7-10 years of construction is estimated.",
  "informations-faq-persons-title": "How many people are involved in the artwork?",
  "informations-faq-persons-text": "As of May 2021, 22 people work on the image.",
  "informations-gallery": "Gallery",
  "informations-gallery-pixeling-title": "Pixeling in Action",
  "informations-gallery-pixeling-text": "In this image, image #0 and #1 are being pixelated. These images were the beginning of something really big. Admittedly, at the time the thought of having 497 more plates to go was very frightening.",
  "informations-gallery-base-colors-title": "The basic colors",
  "informations-gallery-base-colors-text": "These are the 16 colors that make up the image. From left to right: purple, violet, blue, water blue, green-blue, green, light green, yellow, brown, orange, red, pink, black, gray, light gray and white.",
  "informations-gallery-base-color-selection-title": "Color selection",
  "informations-gallery-base-color-selection-text": "The supplier of the pixels ({link}) has 312 colors to choose from. To get the perfect match, I ordered all the colors and selected the 16 basic colors. Especially the contrast played a big role. Unfortunately, this could not stand out better with light gray/white and green/light green despite the amount of colors.",
  "informations-gallery-first-pixel-title": "The first pixel",
  "informations-gallery-first-pixel-text": "This is the very first pixel of the image, set on image #0 at the very bottom left on August 11, 2019 at 12:55 PM.",
  "informations-gallery-new-color-plates-title": "Replenishment",
  "informations-gallery-new-color-plates-text": "To be supplied with more pixels, supplies have to be ordered constantly. This was my first order, which is enough for ~10 plates. Because of the big difference in the number of plates of the respective colors, the colors have to be counted (automated, of course). In this example, 51 color plates of the color light gray are needed, but only 2 pixels (one color plate has 140 pixels) of purple.",
  "informations-gallery-image-numbering-title": "Numbering on the back of a plate",
  "informations-gallery-image-numbering-text": "To quickly identify the plates, each back includes a small sticker with the image number and its coordinates. The first number is the image number (0-499) and the two numbers in brackets represent the row and column number. It is counted from the bottom left to the top right. It starts at 0.",
